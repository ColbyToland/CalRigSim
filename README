Calibration Rig Simulator
=========================

Features:
---------

    1) Generate images of calibration targets with accurate lens and perspective 
        distortion.

    2) Modify camera model and target position on the fly via UI.

    3) Calibration feedback loop. 
        a) Pass calibration target images to the calibration algorithm and 
            generate a matching set of images using the calibration results for 
            comparison.

Proposed Features:
------------------

    * Simulated real world effects like specular glare and out of focus areas.

    * External model file definition for calibration target.


Code Structure:
---------------

Classes:    * CalTex class generates ChArUco texture (or others)
            * CalTarget class generates and texture maps the target.
                + CalTex is a member variable of CalTarget
            * Renderman class does OpenGL work and spawns windows
                + UI window is generated by Renderman. Separate class?
                + Includes a render path using results from Calibrator
            * CalData class stores camera parameters and images generated
                by Renderman for calibration.
            * Calibrator class determines camera parameters from images and
                stores them to CalData
